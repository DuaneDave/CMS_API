## ‚ùì FAQ (OPTIONAL) <a name="faq"></a>

- **Why did you use repository design pattern?**

  <p> Repository Pattern introduces an additional layer of abstraction, the benefits it provides in terms of maintainability, testability, and adaptability often outweigh the overhead. It's especially beneficial in larger applications where clear separation of concerns becomes crucial for long-term maintainability.
  Reasons includes:
  </p>

  <ul>
      <li>Separation of Concerns: 
      - Following design patterns like the Repository Pattern aligns with best practices for structuring maintainable and scalable software. It makes your codebase more readable and easier for other developers to understand.
    </li>
      <li>Testability: 
      - The Repository Pattern makes it easier to mock dependencies for testing. This is especially useful in unit testing, where you want to isolate the system under test from its dependencies.
    </li>
      <li>Adaptability: 
      - The Repository Pattern makes it easier to swap out data sources. For example, you can easily replace a repository that fetches data from a remote server with one that uses a local database instead. This is especially useful when you want to write tests that don't touch the network or a database.
    </li>
      <li>Maintainability: 
      - The Repository Pattern makes it easier to maintain your codebase. For example, if you want to change the way you fetch data from a remote server, you only need to change the implementation of the repository. The rest of your codebase can remain the same.
    </li>
  </ul>
